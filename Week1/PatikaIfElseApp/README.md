# Patika - If Else App

This C# application prompts the user to enter a number and performs the following actions:

- Checks if the entered number is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.
- Checks if the entered number is even or odd.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic conditional logic in C#. It allows beginners to understand how to:
- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making.
- Handle user input and validate it using `int.TryParse()`.
- Perform basic arithmetic checks like determining whether a number is even or odd.

This project is ideal for those who are learning the fundamentals of C# programming.

## Code Explanations
- **Input Handling:** The program uses `int.TryParse()` to attempt converting the user's input into an integer. It will keep prompting the user until a valid number is entered.
- **Comparison:** The entered number is compared to 10, and a message is displayed indicating whether it is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.
- **Even/Odd Check:** The program checks if the number is even or odd and displays the result.
