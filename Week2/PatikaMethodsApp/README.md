# Patika - Methods App

This project is a simple C# console application that demonstrates the use of basic methods and user interaction. It contains four distinct methods, each performing a different task. The application allows users to:

1. Display a song lyrics.
2. Generate a random number and calculate its remainder when divided by 2.
3. Multiply two user-provided numbers and display the result.
4. Greet the user with a personalized welcome message based on their first and last name.

This project is designed to showcase how methods can be defined and used in C#, and how user input can be processed and used to perform calculations or display results. It provides a hands-on example of basic programming concepts such as method creation, random number generation, and string manipulation in a console application. Whether you're a beginner learning the basics of C# or looking for a simple example of how to structure a console application, this project serves as a practical and educational reference.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the project is to provide a simple, hands-on example of how methods work in C#. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Method creation and usage
- User input handling
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Random number generation
- String manipulation

By exploring this project, beginners can gain a better understanding of how to structure and implement methods in a C# console application. It serves as a practical tool for learning the basics of C# programming while interacting with the user and performing various tasks. The goal is to help users build confidence in writing their own methods and working with user input in a real-world context.
