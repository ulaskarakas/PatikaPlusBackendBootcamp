# Patika - Do While App

This project demonstrates the usage of the `do-while` loop in C# through a simple console application. Users can input a limit, and the application will repeatedly print a message until the counter reaches the specified limit.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Illustrate the difference between `while` and `do-while` loops in C#.
- Provide a practical example of user input validation.
- Explain how to handle edge cases, such as negative or invalid inputs.

---

## Application Features

1. Prompts the user to enter a positive integer as a limit.
2. Validates user input to ensure it is a non-negative integer.
3. Uses a `do-while` loop to print the message "Ben bir Patika'lıyım" until the counter exceeds the limit.
4. Includes comments to explain the differences between `while` and `do-while` loops.
