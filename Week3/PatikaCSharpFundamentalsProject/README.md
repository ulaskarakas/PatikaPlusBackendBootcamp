# Patika - C# Fundamentals Project

This project includes three fundamental applications written in C# that cover basic programming concepts. Users can select one of the following options to run:

1. **Random Number Finding Game**
2. **Calculator**
3. **Average Grade Calculation**

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience for beginners in C# programming by demonstrating the implementation of core programming concepts such as:

- Loops and conditionals
- User input handling
- Random number generation
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Method usage and modular code design

---

## Application Features

### Random Number Finding Game
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Allows the user to guess the number within 5 attempts.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

### Calculator
- Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- Handles invalid input gracefully.
- Prevents division by zero.

### Average Calculation
- Accepts three grades as input.
- Calculates the average of the grades.
- Assigns a letter grade based on the average.

---

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: Programming language used for development.
- **.NET Core**: Framework for project execution.

---

## Installation and Execution

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. **Clone the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ulaskarakas/CSharpFundamentalsProject.git
   ```
2. **Install .NET SDK:**
   - If not already installed, download the appropriate version from the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) page.

3. **Navigate to the project directory and run the application:**
   ```bash
   cd CSharpFundamentalsProject
   dotnet run
   ```

## Example Usage

1. Upon starting the application, you will be prompted to select one of three programs:
   - Random Number Finding Game
   - Calculator
   - Average Calculation
2. Follow the on-screen instructions for the selected program.
3. For invalid inputs, appropriate error messages will be displayed, and you will be prompted to try again.

## Example Outputs

### Random Number Finding Game
```
Welcome to the Random Number Finding Game!
Guess a number between 1 and 100.
Your remaining life: 5 / Enter your guess: 50
Enter a larger number.
Your remaining life: 4 / Enter your guess: 75
Your guess is correct, Congratulations!
```

### Calculator
```
Please enter the first value for the operation: 10
Please enter the second value for the operation: 5
Please select the operation you want to perform (+, -, *, /): /
10 / 5 = 2
```

### Average Calculation
```
Please enter the first grade: 85
Please enter the second grade: 90
Please enter the third grade: 80
Average of Grades is 85
Letter Grade is BA
```
