# Patika - Array App

This C# program takes 10 numbers from the user, stores them in an array, adds a new element to the array, sorts the array in descending order, and prints the result.

## Project Purpose

This project is to take 10 numbers from the user, create an array with those numbers, then add one more number to the array, and finally sort the array in descending order. Here's a step-by-step explanation:
- **Input 10 Numbers**: The program prompts the user to enter 10 numbers, which are stored in an array (`numbers`). If the user enters an invalid input, it asks again until a valid number is provided.
- **Display Array Elements**: The elements of the array are printed to the console.
- **Resize Array**: The array size is increased by one to accommodate an additional element.
- **Add One More Number**: The program prompts the user to enter one more number, which is added to the end of the array.
- **Sort and Reverse the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order and then reversed to display the elements in descending order.
- **Display Sorted and Reversed Array**: Finally, the sorted and reversed array elements are printed to the console.

This program is a good example for learning basic C# operations such as user interaction, array manipulation, and sorting.
