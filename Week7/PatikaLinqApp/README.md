# Patika - Linq App

This program demonstrates how to filter and transform a list of integers using LINQ in C#. The program processes a list of integers and applies various filtering and transformation operations to display specific subsets of numbers.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use LINQ (Language Integrated Query) in C# to filter and transform a list of integers. By applying different LINQ methods such as `Where` and `Select`, the program showcases how to extract specific subsets of data (e.g., even numbers, odd numbers, negative numbers) and perform transformations like squaring the numbers. This serves as a simple yet effective example of how LINQ can be used to manipulate collections in C#.
